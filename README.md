# menu-and-list-generator
Python program that non-randomly generates a seven-day menu and also the corresponding shopping list for the menu taking into account how difficult a meal is to make, the main carbohydrate type it has, the meal type (vegetarian, fish or meat) and other factors. The menu is drawn from a number of meal files (.txt files with the corresponding meal characteristics and ingredients) which can be created, edited or removed. The general structure of the program involved a number of functions which carry out the specific tasks of making a new meal file, changing a meal file, deleting a meal file, finding what meal files are in the recipe book directory, randomly selecting meals, generating a menu and out-putting the corresponding list. These functions are inside a while loop, which until an exit is performed, will leave all the menu options open. The list file is exported as a .txt file with a date and time stamp. Testing.
